This is a small Amiibo search engine that features all Amiibo released in North America as of April 1st, 2017. All Amiibo have compatibility tables that can be seen by hovering over them and wiki pages that can be accessed by clicking on the image of them. They also have links to their Amazon page by clicking the Amazon button under each one. Release dates of all Amiibos can be found under their pictures.
